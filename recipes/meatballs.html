  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    <li>1 onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>2 eggs </li>
    <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until translucent, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix beef and pork together in a large bowl. Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
